# SOC (Security Operations Center)

The SOC is the team responsible for monitoring the network 24/7 to **detect and prevent malicious events.** 

Their main focuses are the detection and remediation of vulnerabilities, the enforcement of policy violations, and the blocking of unauthorized activity and network intrusions, acting to prevent damage.

# Threat Intelligence (TI) 
This is the process of collecting and analyzing data about real and potential adversaries. The objective is to understand the attackers' Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), allowing the company to develop a threat-informed defense and anticipate malicious activity. 

The process includes data collection (logs, public sources), processing, and analysis to generate actionable recommendations.

# DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) 
DFIR covers the investigation and response to attacks.

**1. Digital Forensics:** This is the application of science to analyze evidence of an attack on digital systems. It focuses on analyzing the file system, system memory, network, and system logs to discover what happened and who was involved.

**2. Incident Response (IR):** This is the structured methodology for handling an incident (attack or breach) aiming to reduce damage and recover systems quickly. The process has four essential phases: Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity.

**3. Malware Analysis:** The study of malicious software (Virus, Trojan Horse, Ransomware). It is performed through Static analysis (inspecting code without execution) or Dynamic analysis (execution in a controlled environment to observe behavior).
